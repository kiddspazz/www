  At the heart of it, computers use binary because a) logic is easier with Boolean values and b) voltage doesn't lend itself to defined levels, while present and absent are easily defined. 

  It turns out there are many ways to physically implement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra">boolean logic</a>, named after it's inventor George Boole, which is a branch of logic and math where the only values are binary in nature (eg 1 & 0, true & false). You can actually <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=build+logic+gates">build logic gates</a> with transistors, which regulate voltage.

  So, we can study the abstraction thereof completely theoretically.

  Furthermore, it is possible to construct the two types of basic computer architecture (memory devices & processing devices) using Boolean functions.
