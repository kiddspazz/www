        <h1>What is a compiler and why do I need it?</h1>
        <p>I recently (October 23rd, 2019) updated my MacOS to Catalina. I had been learning Rust and went to compile my code after the update and got an error: "<code>error: linking with 'cc' failed: exit code: 1</code>."</p>
        <P>After asking a general tech group chat, I was told it was because the command line tools were probably removed with the update. Sure enough they were gone, and installing them again fixed the problem. <b>However</b>, I realized that because I've been writing primarily JavaScript, I don't really understand what a compiler or a linker is or does. So, research time.</p>
        <div>
          <p><h1>A compiler</h1> reads, analyses and translates code into either an object file or a list of error messages.</p>
          <p>See, computers really only speak one language: machine code, which is ones and zeros. To get from the nice, human-readable code that we write, it has to get translated to machine code. Generally, computers come with a built-in assembly-code-to-machine-code compiler (translator) [TO BE FINISHED]</p>
          <p><h1>A linker</h1> combines one or more object files and possible some library code into either some executable, some library or a list of error messages. [WRITE SOMETHING MORE HERE?]</p>
          <p>That was easy. I think the thing to note here is that some languages don't need compiling or linking (JavaScript) and some do. Languages that don't need a compiler or linker are called interpreted languages.</p>
          <ul>Some interpreted languages (from Wikipedia):
            <li>Javascript</li>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>Ruby</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>Some non-interpreted languages:
            <li>c++</li>
            <li>Rust</li>
            <li>Elm</li>
            <li>Go</li>
            <li>And many others</li>
