        <p>I'm Travis. I attended the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.recurse.com">Recurse Center</a> Spring 1, 2019 batch: February 18 - May 9. It was a great time, I met a lot of amazing people, and I learned a ton. <a href="/portfolio/">Here</a> are some of the projects I worked on while I was there and before.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Last year, my wife and I decided to leave our 7 year home of Brooklyn for the road, and we bought an RV and did just that. I studied programming part time during that year while I worked half-time as an accountant for the <a href="https://brooklynyouthchorus.org/" target="_blank">Brooklyn Youth Chorus</a>.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I studied piano for 6 years at <a href="https://www.uncsa.edu/" target="_blank">UNC-School of the Arts</a> and 2 more years at the <a href="http://necmusic.edu/" target="_blank">New England Conservatory</a>. I moved to New York City in 2011 and worked as a pianist there for 7 years&#x2014;played Carnegie Hall, Joe's Pub, off-Broadway shows, worked for NYU and the <a href="https://brooklynyouthchorus.org/" target="_blank">Brooklyn Youth Chorus</a> as a vocal coach and staff pianist. <a href="./journal/" style="text-decoration: none;">I</a> rode my bicycle a lot.</p>
